# LearningGroebnerPolyAddDeepValueModel
Code for recreating the analyses from ``[Learning a performance metric of Buchberger’s algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03676)" by Jelena Mojsilović, Dylan Peifer, Sonja Petrović. 

The python code for both regression and network training is here <https://github.com/Sondzus/LearningGroebnerPolyAddDeepValueModel>. 

The code used to generate the data uses the RMI package and new functions [here](https://github.com/RandCommAlg/RMI/tree/randomToricIdeals), and has been merged to [Peifer's M2 folder](https://github.com/dylanpeifer/deepgroebner/tree/master/m2).
